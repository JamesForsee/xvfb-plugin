<div>When running multiple Jenkins nodes on the same machine this
	setting influences the display number generation. The display number
	will be based upon node position in the list of nodes multiplied by 100
	to which current executor number and any given offset will be added.
	Using this with offset set to 0 there is a limit of 595 nodes and 35
	executors on a node, having more nodes or executors is not compatible
	with this option.</div>
